# Day Planner 


## Description

This is the fifth weeks homework assignment. The task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. The app should run in a broswer and feature dymaically updated HTML and CSS combined with JQuery. 

The acceptance criteria for the project were as follows:
- When planner is opened the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- When the page is scrolled there should be time blocks for the standard business hours.
- Each time block should be color-coded to indicate whether it is past, present, or future.
- When time block is clicked, you can enter an appointment.
- When the save button is clicked, the text for the appointment is saved in local storage.
- When the page is refreshed the appointment is still saved.

The application required the use of a JavaScript library. I used the Moment.js library even though it is no longer supported by its developers. I found it easy to use and understand and worked for my needs. I also used bootstrap and found it fun to play around with again as it really has somethings that were very useful to this project. In particular I really like the use of the form-control to saved appointments. I also found the use of spacing useful from bootstrap. I found the use Font Awesome to be helpful to find a save button icon.

This project was a real challenge to me, particaully the JavaScript portion with the use of JQuery. I do feel I have completed all the requirements and have learned so much.
